### Hi there! I'm Blanca ðŸ––

I'm a curious data lover who decided to make a career change from architecture to data science and recently finished a Data Immersive bootcamp at [AllWomen Academy ](https://www.allwomen.tech/).

During this exciting full-time course, I have learnt about:

* Programming in Python
* Descriptive Statistics
* Web Scraping
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization and storytelling 
* Probability
* Hypothesis testing
* Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms
* Natural language processing
* SQL

I'm currently looking for an entry level position in the Data Science & Analytics field, and I'm always open to collaborate on projects that make a possitive impact.
